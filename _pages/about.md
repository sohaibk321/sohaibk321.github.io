I'm a data scientist who excels at machine learning, exploratory data analysis, and time series analysis. I spend most of my time working on a few things:

## Machine Learning and Exploring Artificial Intelligence
My work revolves around finding patterns in complex sets of data to uncover actionable insight. I primarily use Python for machine learning purposes, but I'm learning about new tools and technologies every day in order to expand my skillset.

## Weightlifting and Gymnastics
One of my quintessential goals in life is uncovering the full depths of the capabilities of my body. For that end, I regularly practice gymnastic strength training for my upper body and weightlifting for my  body. I live by the saying of Socrates, "...what a disgrace it is for a man to grow old without ever seeing the beauty and strength of which his body is ."

## Hiking
One of my current passions is hiking and exploring the beauty in nature. This gives me time to relax my mind and feel more connected with the outside world. Considering most of my time is spent sitting and staring at a computer screen, this is a well needed reprieve for both my body and my mind. My favorite spot for now is the Great Falls hiking trail for its multitude of options available for people of different levels.

# What I did before
Before my journey of pursuing data science for a career and becoming an expert in machine learning, I was a research oriented student studying pre-medicine and psychology in Virginia Commonwealth University. I spent the last 2 years of my time in college working as a research analyst and eventually publishing my own paper with my team on the effects of different therapies for alleviating depression and reducing alcohol consumption in college students.
It was here where my professor in cognition and learning exposed me to the world of neurophysiology and the great depth of analysis required to uncover the depths of what it means to be human. I knew that this was the field for me as I've always been a curious person who wants to understand the complexities of the world.
To this end, I started taking up programming in my spare time to learn python, a little bit of java, and SQL so that I can prepare myself for the rigors of machine learning and artificial intelligence.

# What I hope to do in the future
One of the principles that I live by is life-long learning. I believe we as humans have such great capabilities that have yet to be realized and its only through a journey of growth and challenges can one achieve the best version of themselves.
The world of machine learning and AI is rapidly gaining traction and will likely set the stage by which many problems in the future will be solved by. I wish to work on a path that allows me to become a machine learning engineer as I continue to hone my skills in the industry and gain knowledge through post-university education. My recent focus has been on time series analysis and how neural networks can be used to better predict sequential data. I will continue to work on this expanding field and if you believe there are projects that could use this type of analysis, then let's talk!
